## 🔍 **Brand Essence**

Fendo Golf is a *performance-driven golf innovation brand* centered on helping golfers elevate their short game with purpose, discipline, and community. Their philosophy is simple: **scoring is decided inside 150–160 yards**, yet most golfers overlook the habits, tools, and education needed to excel there. Fendo exists to change that. ([Fendo Golf][1])

## 🏌️‍♂️ **Core Mission**

**To elevate the short game through smarter preparation, better tools, and a community that lives the craft.**
